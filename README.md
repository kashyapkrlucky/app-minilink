# URL Shortener App

A simple URL shortening service built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that allows users to shorten long URLs and track their stats. This app offers both frontend and backend components, with modern features like link click tracking, user authentication, and more.

## Features

- **Shorten URLs**: Convert long URLs into short, easily shareable links.
- **Track Clicks**: Monitor how many times a shortened URL has been clicked.
- **User Authentication**: Create an account and log in to manage your links.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easy copying of shortened URLs with a single click.
- **Link Stats**: View statistics such as the number of clicks and the creation date of each shortened link.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication
- **Deployment**: Docker (optional)
- **Development Tools**: Webpack, Babel, ESLint, Prettier

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** and **npm**: You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB**: You can set up a local MongoDB instance or use a service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup (API)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/url-shortener.git
   cd url-shortener
   ```
````

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:

   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=5000
   ```

5. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following:

   ```bash
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. Start the frontend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Docker Setup (Optional)

If you prefer to use Docker for deployment, the project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file. Follow these steps to run both the frontend and backend in Docker containers:

1. Build and start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### Creating a Shortened URL

- Enter a long URL into the input field on the homepage and click the "Shorten" button.
- A shortened URL will be displayed, and you can copy it to your clipboard or click it to visit the destination.

### Viewing Link Statistics

- Navigate to the **Link Stats** page from the navigation to view a list of all your shortened URLs along with their click count and creation date.

### Authentication

- To manage your shortened links, create an account or log in using the provided authentication flow.
- User authentication is handled with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
